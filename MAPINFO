Oh no, not again!
Haven't they had enough already???
This goddamn outpost doesn't have
sufficent firepower to deal with
another invasion of that size!
You have to get away from here ASAP.

Your only means of escape:
reaching the refinery close by. From
there, you might find a way to activate
a long range distress beacon. You
wonder, if any of your fellow
marines are still alive out there..."

Through this underground tunnel you're
about to reach some of your fellow
marines, which are holding out somewhere
nearby. While you stumble through merely
darkness, one of them tunes in on your
intercom:
 
 'Marine, the situation looks bleak! We are
 cornered in an UAC research complex,
 getting worn down!
 Demons are pouring out of nowhere and all
 defenses are offline, so we cannot hold
 out much longer!'

surface...

As you kill the last remains of invaders
you feel the earth shaking as if something
is really pissed about your interference.

But what is this place anyway? It looks like
two dimensions are intertwining and you seem
to lose grip to the real world. Your world.

Once more, the only way out is through.
Good thing you got your hands on some
serious firepower by now.

Suddenly everything around you blurs and
the complex you came from vanishes into
nothingness. Welcome back to hell...

were your ticket back and killing them
put an end to all of this, you knew that
they were just part of something much
bigger.

So you've made it through all 13,5 levels.
13,5? Yeah of course, map 14 isn't done
yet. There's much more to come!

Deeper twists into the story,
more levels,
more badass action...

I really hope you had as much fun playing
as I had creating this.

STAY TUNED!"
